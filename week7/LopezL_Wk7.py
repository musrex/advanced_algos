# Task 1
# Create a program that generates a random array of 10,000 elements
# with equal number of 0's and 1's
# and then implement the randomized Las Vegas algorithm
# that searches for an element holding a 1
# Your program should output the position of the first 1 found, plus the number of tries before finding it.

 

# Task 2
# Create a program that generates a random array of 10,000 elements
# with equal number of 0's and 1's
# and then implement the randomized Monte Carlo algorithm
# that searches for an element holding a 1
# Set k equal to 10
# Your program should output the position of the first 1 found, plus the number of tries before finding it or a message stating that it did not find the 1 after k attempts.
