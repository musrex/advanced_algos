Linear Programming has many useful applications. It can be used to optimize routes for delivery, or to maximize financial portfolio returns while considering things like risk. The pizza and sandwich example we saw in class also demonstrates how it can be used for production or manufacturing. This can also be applied to computer science to help maximize things like memory allocation or network usage to help maximize performance while reducing costs. While linear programming is useful for certain problems, others might pose more challenges. As more constraints are introduced, a linear programming approach might require an excessive amount of resources. Other problems just aren't suited either. For instance, linear programming assumes a static view of the world, and certain things like the stock market just aren't static.
